# Performance Analysis of Quicksort Algorithms

This project compares the efficiency and scalability of **Randomized Quicksort** and **Deterministic Quicksort** using Python.

## Files
- `randomized_quicksort.py`: Implements Randomized Quicksort with random pivot selection.
- `deterministic_quicksort_v2.py`: Implements Deterministic Quicksort with the last-element pivot selection and includes performance measurement.
- `performance_graph.png`: Bar chart comparing execution times across different test cases.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x and ensure `matplotlib` is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
